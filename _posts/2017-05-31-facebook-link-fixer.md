## Preamble 
As we all know, Facebook cannot afford a couple of developers. Sometimes it is funny. 
But sometimes it is getting really ridiculous, so someone's gotta do the work.

## Problem 
When you copy a link to post from your mobile browser, you get something like this: 
`https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid={post_id}&id={user_id}`
When you send someone this link and an addressee clicks it, he sees this ðŸ’©:

![facebðŸ’©k](/images/facebook.png "FacebðŸ’©k")

## Here is what you do with this ðŸ’©:

{% include facebook_link_fixer.html %}

Enjoy!
