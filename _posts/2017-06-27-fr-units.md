[What is *in a nutshell*](/tag/in-a-nutshell/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

1. `fr` stands for *fraction*. 
1. It means *one part*. `1fr` means `x`, `2fr` means `2x`.
1. Say we have 60 balls in a box. `1fr` of them are red and `2fr` of them are green. It means `20 red` and `40 green` balls.
1. Introduced and can be used only as part of *grid layout* in `grid-rows` and `grid-columns`.
1. Difference between *fractions* and *percents* is that *fractions* **do not count gaps** between grid elements:
