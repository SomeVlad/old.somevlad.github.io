## Preamble

I'm an active Telegram user and sometimes I find it frustrating and
unhandy to do some routine stuff. And not so long ago I bethought
myself that I'm a wannabe programmer and it's my duty to subdue a machine
and make it do stuff that regular meatbag like me doesn't want to.

I also realised that I use my [facebook links unshitter](/facebook-link-fixer/)
quite often and hey, wouldn't it be nice ~~if we were older~~ to have
a bot pinned to top that does this and other useful things.

## So I made it!

[There it is](https://t.me/swiss_knife_bot)!

[And there is a github repo](https://github.com/SomeVlad/swiss-knife-bot).

[And here you can stay for updates](https://t.me/vladsamoylov).

## What this bot is capable of?

For now it can do these things:
- convert shitty mobile facebook links into pretty parseable desktop ones;
- keep all the text surrounding links, so you can type whatever
you want to share among with the link to convert and just
copypaste/forward the resulting message;
- that's it. For now.

## What do you want it to be capable of?

[Do not hesitate to inform me via Telegram](https://t.me/some_vlad).

## And what if the bot doesn't do what it's supposed to?

Well... You know the answer, I don't need to point that out. Right?
